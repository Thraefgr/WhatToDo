Hey there! This is my classic to do project.
You can add stuff, and save them locally!
And by pressing the "Clear" button you can delete everything that is in your local storage so be carefull!
Currently It doesnt have ability to delete a specific "to do job". I will add that on the upcoming days.
Sooooo thats all I have to say, have good day!

IMPORTANT Note: As I said before, "clear" button deletes EVERYTHING so be carefull and delete only when you dont have anything "to do".
